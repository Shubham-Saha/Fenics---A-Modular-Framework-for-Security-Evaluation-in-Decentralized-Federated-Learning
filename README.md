**Fenics** is a comprehensive simulator designed for decentralized federated learning environments. It allows researchers and practitioners to experiment with various network topologies, participant selection strategies, and attack scenarios to evaluate the robustness and efficiency of federated learning algorithms.

This is the historical branch of the Fenics framework. 

As a true phoenix, Fenics has now evolved into https://github.com/annalithell/blixtbird.

For the version 1 of our framework, see [README.v1.md](README.v1.md).
